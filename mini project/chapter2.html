            <p>When Corey texted me last night to let me know about the
                meeting today, it was the first time I’d heard from him in
                months. I was sitting at my computer desk, staring down at an
                ant as it crawled across my big toe.<br>
                <br>
                The ant was alone, fluttering left and right, up and down,
                searching for food or friends. He seemed confused by his
                solitude. Or maybe he was excited for his newfound freedom.
                I couldn’t help but wonder why he was alone. Ants usually
                travel with an army.<br>
                <br>
                The fact that I was curious about the ant’s current situation
                was a clear sign I needed to leave my apartment. I was worried
                that, after being cooped up caring for my mother for so long,
                once I stepped out into the hallway I would be just as confused
                as that ant. Left, right, inside, outside, where are my friends,
                where is the food?<br>
                <br>
                The ant crawled off my toe and onto the hardwood floor.
                He disappeared beneath the wall when Corey’s texts came
                through.<br>
                <br>
                I was hoping when I drew a line in the sand months ago,
                he’d understand: since we no longer have sex, the most
                appropriate method of contact between a literary agent and his
                author is email.<br>
                <br>
                His text read: Meet me tomorrow morning at nine at the
                Pantem Press building, floor 14. I think we might have an
                offer.<br>
                <br>
                He didn’t even ask about my mom in the text. I wasn’t
                surprised. His lack of interest in anything other than his job
                and himself are the reasons we’re no longer together. His lack
of concern made me feel unjustly irritated. He doesn’t owe me
anything, but he could have at least acted like he cared.<br>
<br>
I didn’t text him back at all last night. Instead, I set down
my phone and stared at the crack at the base of my wall—the
one the ant had disappeared into. I wondered if he would find
other ants in the wall, or if he was a loner. Maybe he was like
me and had an aversion to other ants.<br>
<br>
It’s hard to say why I have such a deeply crippling
aversion to other humans, but if I had to wager a bet, I’d say
it’s a direct result of my own mother being terrified of me.
Terrified may be a strong word. But she certainly didn’t
trust me as a child. She kept me fairly secluded from people
outside of school because she was afraid of what I might be
capable of during my many sleepwalking episodes.<br>
<br> That
paranoia bled into my adulthood, and by then, I was set in my
ways. A loner. Very few friends and not much of a social life.
Which is why this is the first morning I’ve left my apartment
since weeks before she passed away.<br>
<br>
I figured my first trip outside of my apartment would be
somewhere I missed, like Central Park or a bookstore.
I certainly didn’t think I’d find myself here, standing in
line in the lobby of a publishing house, desperately praying
whatever this offer is will catch me up on my rent and I won’t
be evicted. But here I am, one meeting away from either being
homeless or receiving a job offer that will give me the means
to look for a new apartment.<br>
<br>
I look down and smooth out the white shirt Jeremy lent me
in the bathroom across the street. I’m hoping I don’t look too
ridiculous. Maybe there’s a chance I can pull it off, as if
wearing men’s shirts twice my size is some cool new fashion
statement.<br>
<br>
“Nice shirt,” someone behind me says.<br>
<br>
I turn at the sound of Jeremy’s voice, shocked to see him.<br>
<br>
Is he following me?<br>
<br>
It’s my turn in line, so I hand the security guard my
driver’s license and then look at Jeremy, taking in the new
shirt he’s wearing. “Do you keep spare shirts in your back
pocket?” It hasn’t been that long since he gave me the one off
his back.<br>
<br>
“My hotel is a block away. Walked back to change.”<br>
<br>
His hotel. That’s promising. If he’s staying in a hotel,
maybe he doesn’t work here. And if he doesn’t work here,
maybe he isn’t in the publishing industry. I’m not sure why I
don’t want him to be in the publishing industry. I just have no
idea who my meeting is with, and I’m hoping it has nothing to
do with him after the morning we’ve already had. “Does that
mean you don’t work in this building?”<br>
<br>
He pulls out his identification and hands it to the security
guard. “No, I don’t work here. I have a meeting on the
fourteenth floor.”<br>
<br>
Of course he does.<br>
<br>
“So do I,” I say.<br>
<br>
A fleeting smile appears on his mouth and disappears just
as quickly, as if he remembered what happened across the
street and realized it’s still too soon to not be affected. “What
are the chances we’re heading to the same meeting?” He takes
his identification back from the guard who points us in the
direction of the elevators.<br>
<br>
“I wouldn’t know,” I say. “I haven’t been told exactly why
I’m here yet.” We walk onto the elevator, and he presses the
button for the fourteenth floor. He faces me as he pulls his tie
out of his pocket and begins to put it on.<br>
<br>
I can’t stop staring at his wedding ring.<br>
<br>
“Are you a writer?” he asks.<br>
<br>
I nod. “Are you?”<br>
<br>
“No. My wife is.” He pulls at his tie until it’s secured in
place. “Have you written anything I would know?”<br>
<br>
“I doubt it. No one reads my books.”<br>
<br>
His lips turn up. “There aren’t many Lowens in the world.
I’m sure I can figure out which books you’ve written.”
Why? Does he actually want to read them? He looks down
at his phone and begins to type.<br>
<br>
“I never said I write under my real name.”<br>
<br>
He doesn’t look up from his phone until the elevator doors
open. He moves toward them, turning in the doorway to face
me. He holds up his phone and smiles. “You don’t write under
a pen name. You write under Lowen Ashleigh, which, funny
enough, is the name of the author I’m meeting at nine thirty.”
I finally get that smile, and as gorgeous as it is, I don’t
want it anymore.<br>
<br>
He just Googled me. And even though my meeting is at
nine, not nine thirty, he seems to know more about it than I do.
If we really are headed to the same meeting, it makes our
chance meeting on the street seem somewhat suspicious. But I
guess the odds of us both being in the same place at the same
time aren’t all that inconceivable, considering we were headed
in the same direction to the same meeting, and therefore,
witnessed the same accident.<br>
<br>
Jeremy steps aside, and I exit the elevator. I open my
mouth, preparing to speak, but he takes a few steps, walking
backward. “See you in a few.”<br>
<br>
I don’t know him at all, nor do I know how he relates to
the meeting I’m about to have, but even without being privy to
any details of what’s happening this morning, I can’t help but
like the guy. The man literally gave me the shirt off his back,
so I doubt he has a vindictive nature.<br>
<br>
I smile before he rounds the corner. “Alright. See you in a
few.”<br>
<br>
He returns the smile. “Alright.”<br>
<br>
I watch him until he makes a left and disappears. As soon
as I’m out of his line of sight, I’m able to relax a little. This
morning has just been…a lot. Between the accident I
witnessed and being in enclosed spaces with that confusing
man, I’m feeling so strange. I press my palm against the wall
and lean into it. What the hell—<br>
<br>
“You’re on time,” Corey says. His voice startles me. I spin
around, and he’s walking up to me from the opposite hallway.<br>
<br>
He leans in and kisses me on the cheek. I stiffen.<br>
<br>
“You’re never on time.”<br>
<br>
“I would have been here sooner, but…” I shut up. I don’t
explain what prevented me from being early. He seems
disinterested as he heads in the same direction as Jeremy.
“The actual meeting isn’t until nine thirty, but I figured
you’d be late, so I told you nine.”<br>
<br>
I pause, staring at the back of his head. What the hell,
Corey? If he’d told me nine thirty rather than nine, I wouldn’t
have witnessed the accident across the street. I wouldn’t have
been subjected to a stranger’s blood.<br>
<br>
“You coming?” Corey asks, pausing to look back at me.
I bury my irritation. I’m used to doing that when it comes
to him.<br>
<br>
We make it to an empty conference room. Corey closes the
door behind us, and I take a seat at the conference table. He
sits next to me at the head of the table, positioning himself so
that he’s staring at me. I try not to frown as I take in the sight
of him after our months-long hiatus, but he hasn’t changed.
Still very clean, groomed, wearing a tie, glasses, a smile.
Always such a stark contrast to myself.<br>
<br>
“You look terrible.” I say it because he doesn’t look
terrible. He never does, and he knows it.<br>
<br>
“You look refreshed and ravishing.” He says it because I
never look refreshed and ravishing. I always look tired, and
maybe even perpetually bored. I’ve heard of Resting Bitch
Face, but I relate more to Resting Bored Face.<br>
<br>
“How’s your mother?”<br>
<br>
“She died last week.”<br>
<br>
He wasn’t expecting that. He leans back in his chair and
tilts his head. “Why didn’t you tell me?”<br>
<br>
Why haven’t you bothered asking until now? I shrug. “I’m
still processing.”<br>
<br>
My mother had been living with me for the past nine
months—since she was diagnosed with stage four colon
cancer. She passed away last Wednesday after three months on
hospice. It was difficult to leave the apartment in those last
few months because she relied on me for everything—from
drinking, to eating, to turning her over in her bed. When she
took a turn for the worse, I wasn’t able to leave her alone at
all, which is why I didn’t step foot outside of my apartment for
weeks. Luckily, a Wi-Fi connection and a credit card make it
easy to live life completely indoors in Manhattan. Anything
and everything a person could possibly need can be delivered.
Funny how one of the most populated cities in the world
can double as a paradise for agoraphobics.<br>
<br>
“You okay?” Corey asks.<br>
<br>
I mask my disquiet with a smile, even if his concern is
only a formality. “I’m fine. It helps that it was expected.” I’m
only saying what I think he wants to hear. I’m not sure how
he’d react to the truth—that I’m relieved she’s gone. My
mother only ever brought guilt into my life. Nothing less,
nothing more. Just consistent guilt.<br>
<br>
Corey heads for the counter lined with breakfast pastries,
bottles of water, and a coffee carafe. “You hungry? Thirsty?”
“Water’s fine.”<br>
<br>
He grabs two waters and hands one to me, then returns to
his seat. “Do you need help with the will? I’m sure Edward
can help.”<br>
<br>
Edward is the lawyer at Corey’s literary agency. It’s a
small agency, so a lot of the writers use Edward’s expertise in
other areas. Sadly, I won’t be needing it. Corey tried to tell me
when I signed the lease on my two-bedroom last year that I
wouldn’t be able to afford it. But my mother insisted she die
with dignity—in her own room. Not in a nursing home. Not in
a hospital. Not in a hospital bed in the middle of my efficiency
apartment. She wanted her own bedroom with her own things.
She promised what was left in her bank account after her
death would help me catch up on all the time off I had to take
from my writing career. For the past year, I’ve lived off what
little advance I had left over from my last publishing contract.
But it’s all gone now, and apparently, so is my mother’s
money. It was one of the last things she confessed to me before
she finally succumbed to the cancer. I would have cared for
her regardless of her financial situation. She was my mother.
But the fact that she felt she needed to lie to me in order for
me to agree to take her in proves how disconnected we were
from one another.<br>
<br>
I take a sip of my water and then shake my head. “I don’t
really need a lawyer. All she left me was debt, but thanks for
the offer.”<br>
<br>
Corey purses his lips. He knows my financial situation
because, as my literary agent, he’s the one who sends my
royalty checks. Which is why he’s looking at me with pity
now. “You have a foreign royalty check coming soon,” he
says, as if I’m not aware of every penny coming in my
direction for the next six months. As if I haven’t already spent
it.<br>
<br>
“I know. I’ll be fine.” I don’t want to talk about my
financial issues with Corey. With anyone.<br>
<br>
Corey shrugs a little, unconvinced. He looks down and
straightens up his tie. “Hopefully this offer will be good for
both of us,” he says.<br>
<br>
I’m relieved the subject is changing. “Why are we meeting
in person with a publisher? You know I prefer to do things
over email.”<br>
<br>
“They requested the meeting yesterday. Said they have a
job they’d like to discuss with you, but they wouldn’t give me
any details over the phone.”<br>
<br>
“I thought you were working on getting another contract
with my last publisher.”<br>
<br>
“Your books do okay, but not well enough to secure
another contract without sacrificing some of your time. You
have to agree to engage in social media, go on tour, build a fan
base. Your sales alone aren’t cutting it in the current market.”
I was afraid of this. A contract renewal with my current
publisher was all the financial hope I had left. The royalty
checks from my previous books have dwindled along with my
book sales. I’ve done very little writing this past year because
of my commitment to my mother, so I have nothing to sell to a
publisher.<br>
<br>
“I have no idea what Pantem will offer, or if it’s even
something you’ll be interested in,” Corey says. “We have to
sign a non-disclosure agreement before they’ll give us more
details. The secrecy has me curious, though. I’m trying not to
get my hopes up, but there are a lot of possibilities and I have
a good feeling. We need this.”<br>
<br>
He says we because whatever the offer is, he gets fifteen
percent if I accept. It’s the agent-client standard. What isn’t the
agent-client standard would be the six months we spent in a
relationship and the two years of sex that followed our
breakup.<br>

Our sexual relationship only lasted as long as it did
because he wasn’t serious about anyone else and neither was I.
It was convenient until it wasn’t. But the reason our actual
relationship was so short-lived is because he was in love with
another woman.<br>
<br>
Never mind that the other woman in our relationship was
also me.<br>

It has to be confusing, falling in love with a writer’s words
before you meet the actual writer. Some people find it difficult
to separate a character from the individual who created them.
Corey, surprisingly, is one of those people, despite being a
literary agent. He met and fell in love with the female
protagonist of my first novel, Open Ended, before he ever
spoke to me. He assumed my character’s personality was a
close reflection of my own, when in fact, I couldn’t be more
opposite from her<br>
